Maps: Fundamentals

13.1 Create a new book, but this time, as a Map. Assign it to the bookMap variable. Use this array as initial data:

```
[['title', 'Clean Code'], ['author', 'Robert C. Martin']]
```

13.2 Set a new key in bookMap called pages, and assign it with a number 464.

13.3 Get the title and author values from bookMap, and log to the console a string formatted like that: "${title} by ${author}".

13.4 Get the size of bookMap, and log it to the console.

13.5 Check if bookMap has the author key. and if so, log "The author of the book is known" to the console.
